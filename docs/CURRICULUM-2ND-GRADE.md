These are the interactive widget types available in TinkerSchool, defined in `/Users/light/dev/m5stack/m5stickc-plus2/lib/activities/types.ts`:

| Widget Type | Best For | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `multiple_choice` | Knowledge checks, comprehension | Pick 1 correct answer from 2-4 options |
| `counting` | Math counting exercises | Tap objects to count them |
| `matching_pairs` | Vocabulary, associations | Draw lines to connect related items |
| `sequence_order` | Ordering, sequencing | Drag items into correct order |
| `flash_card` | Vocabulary, facts, review | Flip card to reveal answer, self-assess |
| `fill_in_blank` | Equations, spelling, sentences | Type or select answer for blank in template |
| `number_bond` | Part-part-whole, addition/subtraction | Three connected circles showing whole = part + part |
| `ten_frame` | Making 10, addition to 20 | 2x5 grid for placing counters |
| `number_line` | Addition, subtraction, comparison | Hop along a number line |
| `rekenrek` | Subitizing, addition, subtraction | Virtual counting rack with colored beads |

### Potential New Widgets for 2nd Grade

These widget types are NOT yet built but would significantly enhance 2nd grade content:

| Proposed Widget | Subject Use | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `clock_face` | Math (Time) | Interactive analog clock with draggable hands |
| `money_counter` | Math (Money) | Drag coins/bills to reach a target amount |
| `bar_graph` | Math/PS (Data) | Build and read simple bar graphs |
| `fraction_visual` | Math (Fractions) | Partition circles/rectangles into equal parts |
| `word_builder` | Reading (Phonics) | Drag letter tiles to build words |
| `sentence_builder` | Reading (Grammar) | Drag word cards to form sentences |
| `pixel_grid` | Art (Pixel Art) | Click-to-paint grid for pixel art creation |
| `rhythm_grid` | Music (Rhythm) | Click beats in a 4/4 or 3/4 time grid |
| `piano_keys` | Music (Melody) | Simple on-screen keyboard for composing |
| `blockly_mini` | Coding | Simplified Blockly workspace within lessons |

**Priority recommendation:** `clock_face`, `money_counter`, and `word_builder` would have the highest impact for 2nd grade content and could be built as reusable components.

## Appendix: UUID Conventions

Following the established pattern from existing migrations:

- **Module IDs:** `10000002-SSNN-4000-8000-000000000001` where SS = subject (01-07), NN = module number
- **Lesson IDs:** `b200000S-NNNN-4000-8000-000000000001` where S = subject, NNNN = lesson number
- **Skill IDs:** `2000000S-NNNN-4000-8000-000000000001` where S = subject, NNNN = skill number
- **Subject IDs:** Reuse existing grade-shared IDs (e.g., Math uses `71c781e1-...` for both grades)

All UUIDs must be hex-only (0-9, a-f). No letters beyond 'f'.
